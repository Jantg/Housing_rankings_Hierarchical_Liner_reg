For those who want to see how it's run, access below.

This repository contains codes and data and resulting shiny app that we created for the final project in STAT523.

It's essentially an extention of my previous repository Housing_rankings but with more bayesian modeling (ordered multinomial hierarchical logistic regression) and Shiny app as an end product.

My part was the idea itself and all the Bayesian modeling with JAGS while my teammates contributed in collecting & organizing data, turning the result of the model into a Shiny with interesting GUIs etc.
